# Calculator 📟

This is a simple calculator program written in Python using the `tkinter` library for creating the graphical user interface and the `math` library for performing mathematical operations. This calculator provides basic arithmetic and some additional functions such as square root and memory storage.

## Examples 📓

- To calculate the square root of 25, enter "25" and click the "√" button, then "=" to get the result.

- To add 7 and 3, enter "7 + 3" and click "=" to get the result.

- To store a number in memory, enter the number and click "M+." You can then recall it later using the "MR" button.

- To clear the current expression, click the "C" button.

 ## Acknowledgments 📌
 This calculator was created as a simple educational project and may have limitations. It serves as a basic example of creating a graphical calculator using Python and tkinter. Feel free to modify and expand upon it for your own learning or use cases.
